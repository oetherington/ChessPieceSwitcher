# LichessPieceSwitcher

A browser extension for switching up the pieces on Lichess. Note that the game
isn't effected, only the sprites that you see on your end. Why? That's a very
good question...

I am not responsible for any ELO losses or brain aneurysms that you may
experience as a result of using this extension.
